./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/AllowArchiveScanning
This policy setting allows you to configure scans for malicious software and unwanted software in archive files such as . ZIP or . CAB files.

If you enable or don't configure this setting, archive files will be scanned.

If you disable this setting, archive files won't be scanned. However, archives are always scanned during directed scans.

 Note

Changes to this setting are not applied when tamper protection is enabled.

./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/AllowCloudProtection
This policy setting allows you to join Microsoft MAPS. Microsoft MAPS is the online community that helps you choose how to respond to potential threats. The community also helps stop the spread of new malicious software infections.

You can choose to send basic or additional information about detected software. Additional information helps Microsoft create new security intelligence and help it to protect your computer. This information can include things like location of detected items on your computer if harmful software was removed. The information will be automatically collected and sent. In some instances, personal information might unintentionally be sent to Microsoft. However, Microsoft won't use this information to identify you or contact you.

Possible options are:

(0x0) Disabled (default) (0x1) Basic membership (0x2) Advanced membership.

Basic membership will send basic information to Microsoft about software that has been detected, including where the software came from, the actions that you apply or that are applied automatically, and whether the actions were successful.

Advanced membership, in addition to basic information, will send more information to Microsoft about malicious software, spyware, and potentially unwanted software, including the location of the software, file names, how the software operates, and how it has impacted your computer.

If you enable this setting, you'll join Microsoft MAPS with the membership specified.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, you won't join Microsoft MAPS.

In Windows 10, Basic membership is no longer available, so setting the value to 1 or 2 enrolls the device into Advanced membership.

./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/AllowEmailScanning
This policy setting allows you to configure e-mail scanning. When e-mail scanning is enabled, the engine will parse the mailbox and mail files, according to their specific format, in order to analyze the mail bodies and attachments. Several e-mail formats are currently supported, for example: pst (Outlook), dbx, mbx, mime (Outlook Express), binhex (Mac). Email scanning isn't supported on modern email clients.

If you enable this setting, e-mail scanning will be enabled.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, e-mail scanning will be disabled.

Unless the ASR rule is disabled, a subsample of audit events are collected for ASR rules with the value of not configured.

Enabled:

Specify the state for each ASR rule under the Options section for this setting.

Enter each rule on a new line as a name-value pair:

Name column: Enter a valid ASR rule ID
Value column: Enter the status ID that relates to state you want to specify for the associated rule.
The following status IDs are permitted under the value column:

1 (Block)

This policy setting allows you to configure the maximum percentage CPU utilization permitted during a scan. Valid values for this setting are a percentage represented by the integers 5 to 100. A value of 0 indicates that there should be no throttling of CPU utilization. The default value is 50.

If you enable this setting, CPU utilization won't exceed the percentage specified.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, CPU utilization won't exceed the default value.

 Note

If you enable both of the following policies, then Windows ignores the value of AvgCPULoadFactor:

./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/CloudBlockLevel
This policy setting determines how aggressive Microsoft Defender Antivirus will be in blocking and scanning suspicious files.

If this setting is on, Microsoft Defender Antivirus will be more aggressive when identifying suspicious files to block and scan; otherwise, it will be less aggressive and therefore block and scan with less frequency.

For more information about specific values that are supported, see the Microsoft Defender Antivirus documentation site.

 Note

This feature requires the "Join Microsoft MAPS" setting enabled in order to function.

Possible options are:

(0x0) Default Microsoft Defender Antivirus blocking level (0x1) Moderate Microsoft Defender Antivirus blocking level, delivers verdict only for high confidence detections (0x2) High blocking level - aggressively block unknowns while optimizing client performance (greater chance of false positives) (0x4) High+ blocking level - aggressively block unknowns and apply additional protection measures (may impact client performance) (0x6) Zero tolerance blocking level - block all unknown executables.

Copy
./Device/Vendor/MSFT/Policy/Config/Defender/CloudExtendedTimeout
This feature allows Microsoft Defender Antivirus to block a suspicious file for up to 60 seconds, and scan it in the cloud to make sure it's safe.

The typical cloud check timeout is 10 seconds. To enable the extended cloud check feature, specify the extended time in seconds, up to an additional 50 seconds.

For example, if the desired timeout is 60 seconds, specify 50 seconds in this setting, which will enable the extended cloud check feature, and will raise the total time to 60 seconds.

 Note

This feature depends on three other MAPS settings - "Configure the 'Block at First Sight' feature; "Join Microsoft MAPS"; "Send file samples when further analysis is required" all need to be enabled.

This policy setting allows you to configure monitoring for incoming and outgoing files, without having to turn off monitoring entirely. It's recommended for use on servers where there is a lot of incoming and outgoing file activity but for performance reasons need to have scanning disabled for a particular scan direction. The appropriate configuration should be evaluated based on the server role.

Note that this configuration is only honored for NTFS volumes. For any other file system type, full monitoring of file and program activity will be present on those volumes.

The options for this setting are mutually exclusive:

0 = Scan incoming and outgoing files (default) 1 = Scan incoming files only 2 = Scan outgoing files only.

Any other value, or if the value doesn't exist, resolves to the default (0).

If you enable this setting, the specified type of monitoring will be enabled.

If you disable or don't configure this setting, monitoring for incoming and outgoing files will be enabled.
